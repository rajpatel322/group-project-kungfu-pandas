    "Firstly we trained our model using the crime data from the past decade(2014-present) so that it can learn as much as possible. Then our stakeholder `Residents of Chicago, UIC students, new settlers and Chicago Police Department` can predict the probabilty of a person getting arrested based on the type of crime, neighborhood, and description of the location. This will be beneficial to determine how safe a neighborhood is. Our model will not give 100% accuracy on the prediction but it will predict the outcome 87.86% of the time correctly, this is significant becuase our model is not overfitting. In other terms, it be able to predict almost 9 out of 10 outcomes correctly. </h1>"

    "\n",
    "- Theft and battery were the most frequently committed crimes out of all the crimes done in Chicago\n",
    "- There is inverse relationship between housing prices and battery (Expensive houses tends to have lower battery cases)\n",
    "- There is no direct relationship between housing prices and theft (Expensive houses still tend to have higher theft crime compare to cheaper houses)\n",
    "- There has been a decrease in theft post covid compared to pre covid in the neighborhoods near UIC\n",
    "- There was no significant change in battery between pre and post covid near UIC\n",
    "- Our model is able to predict about 88% accurately about the outcome of arrest based on type of crime, neighborhood and description of crime.\n",
